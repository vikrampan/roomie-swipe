        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 6, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>RoomieSwipe</strong>. By creating an account or swiping on our platform, you agree to these legally binding terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. The "Platform Nature" of RoomieSwipe</h2>
        <p>RoomieSwipe is a <strong>discovery tool</strong>, not a real estate agency or a background check service. We provide the technology to introduce users to potential roommates ("Matches"), but:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not verify the criminal background of users.</li>
            <li>We do not inspect the physical condition of rooms listed by "Hosts."</li>
            <li>We are not a party to any lease or financial agreement between users.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>⚠️ Safety Notice:</strong> You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users. Always meet in public places first, tell a friend where you are going, and never transfer money before signing a legal lease.
        </div>

        <h2>2. User Conduct & Zero Tolerance</h2>
        <p>To keep RoomieSwipe safe, you agree NOT to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Post photos that are sexually explicit, violent, or belong to someone else.</li>
            <li>Use the platform to solicit money, sell products, or promote OnlyFans/adult content.</li>
            <li>Harass, bully, or discriminate against users based on race, religion, gender, or orientation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use automated systems and user reports to monitor conduct. Violation of these rules will result in an <strong>immediate, permanent ban</strong> without refund or appeal.</p>

        <h2>3. Content Ownership & License</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of the photos you upload. However, by uploading them, you grant RoomieSwipe a worldwide license to host, display, and adapt your content for the purpose of operating the service (e.g., resizing your photo for mobile screens).</p>
        <p>You warrant that you have the right to upload your photos and that they do not infringe on the privacy or intellectual property of others.</p>

        <h2>4. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</p>
        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL ROOMIESWIPE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, BODILY INJURY, OR FINANCIAL LOSS RESULTING FROM COMMUNICATIONS OR MEETINGS WITH OTHER USERS.</p>

        <h2>5. Account Termination</h2>
        <p>You may delete your account at any time via the Settings menu. Upon deletion, your license to us ends, and we will purge your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate your account if we believe you pose a risk to the community.</p>

        <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes arising from these terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Bangalore, Karnataka.</p>
