        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="meta">Effective Date: February 6, 2026</p>

        <p>At <strong>RoomieSwipe</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"), we operate on a principle of "Data Minimalism." We only collect what is strictly necessary to help you find a roommate or a room.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <span class="info-badge">Community Initiative</span><br/>
            <strong>Note on Entity Status:</strong> RoomieSwipe is currently an independent, open-source inspired community project designed to help students and professionals find housing. We are not yet a registered corporation or LLC. This service is provided "as-is" for the benefit of the community.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>To provide our services, we collect the following categories of data:</p>
        
        <h3>A. Information You Provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> When you sign up via Google or Phone, we collect your name, email address, profile photo, and phone number (if verified).</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Age, gender, occupation, budget, lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, drinking, sleep schedule), and bio.</li>
            <li><strong>User Content:</strong> Photos of yourself or your room/apartment that you upload to our secure storage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geolocation Data:</strong> We collect your precise latitude and longitude to calculate the distance between you and potential matches. This is stored as a "Geohash" for efficient querying.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the app, including swipes ("Likes" or "Passes"), matches, and time spent on the platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> IP address, device model, and operating system version for security and debugging purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your data for specific business purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matching Algorithm:</strong> To calculate "Vibe Scores™" and display profiles within your specified radius and budget.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To facilitate secure, in-app messaging between mutual matches without revealing personal contact details.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> To verify accounts (via OTP) and prevent fraudulent behavior or harassment.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Improvements:</strong> To analyze aggregate trends (e.g., "Most popular locations") to improve our app infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Affiliate & Monetization Disclosure</h2>
        <p>RoomieSwipe is a free-to-use community tool. To cover our server costs (Firebase, Maps API), we participate in affiliate marketing programs.</p>
        <p>We may display "Smart Cards" or advertisements within your feed for relevant services (e.g., furniture rental, packers & movers). These links contain tracking cookies. If you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission to support the project at no cost to you.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> We do not share your personal identity (name/email) with these advertisers. They only receive an anonymous signal that a click originated from our app.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention & The "Right to be Forgotten"</h2>
        <p>We respect your right to control your digital footprint. Unlike other platforms that "soft delete" data, we enforce a strict <strong>"Clean Sweep" Deletion Policy</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you choose to delete your account via the Settings menu:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Profile Removal:</strong> Your user document is immediately and permanently deleted from our Cloud Firestore database.</li>
            <li><strong>Media Wipe:</strong> Your photos are physically deleted from our Firebase Storage buckets.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction Purge:</strong> All "Likes" you sent and all "Matches" you created are deleted. You will disappear from other users' chat lists and "Who Liked Me" views.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once this process is triggered, it cannot be undone. We do not retain backups of deleted profiles.</p>

        <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We implement industry-standard security protocols to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is transmitted via HTTPS/SSL and encrypted at rest within Google Cloud infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Canvas Image Protection:</strong> We utilize proprietary canvas-rendering technology to display user images. This prevents standard "right-click to save" actions and automated scraping, ensuring your photos remain within the app environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Strict database security rules ensure that no user can read or write data belonging to another user, except for mutually matched public profile information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We rely on the following third-party processors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> For authentication, hosting, database, and storage services.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Maps Platform / Geofire:</strong> For location processing and geocoding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is strictly restricted to users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect PII from minors. If we discover that a user is under 18, we will immediately delete their account and associated data.</p>

        <h2>8. Liability & Community Nature</h2>
        <p>As an independent project, we strive for uptime and security but provide the service on an "AS IS" basis. We are not a regulated real estate provider. Please exercise caution and common sense when meeting strangers.</p>

        <h2>9. Updates to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the app or via email.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this policy or wish to exercise your data rights, please contact the development team:</p>
